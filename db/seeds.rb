Posture involves bending at the hips, keeping your back straight, and slightly flexing your knees. Align your body parallel to the target line. During the swing, focus on a smooth takeaway, maintaining a wide arc with your arms. At the top of the backswing, your weight should shift to your back foot, and your wrists should hinge naturally.

Consistent practice and possibly lessons from a golf pro can help refine these elements.")
